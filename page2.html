      <p>I started martial early on in my childhood. I was always rough housing with my friends in school and getting in trouble so my parents decided to put in Tae Kwon Do. I was totally against it at first but quickly realized my passion for the arts. I received my black belt in 4 years and decided to take a break to focus on other sports. Over the course of several years I tried out some other arts but they never seemed street worthy. When I was 16 i started bodybuilding and powerlifting which I did up until 22 years of age. I had a friend that had been doing MMA professionally for years and had been trying to get me into his gym but I wasn't having it. One day he finally talked me into just trying a class for free and instantly it became a new obsession. I fell in love with Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and have been practicing and teaching the art for 8 years now. I am currently a brown belt under famed Royce Gracie and I am working towards getting my black belt with in the next year.
